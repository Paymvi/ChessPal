# Testing Plan

## User Testing
We will conduct beta testing by giving the application to three users for several days. Their feedback on usability, clarity of tutoring, and gameplay experience will help us improve further.

## Automated Testing
We will use **Vitest** to test core functionality in `App.jsx` and other key components.

### Planned Test Areas
- **Chessboard Functionality:**  
  - Valid moves are generated correctly  
  - Pieces move according to chess rules  

- **Tutoring System:**  
  - AI feedback appears on the screen without delay  
  - The hint system provides explanations when triggered  

- **General App Behavior:**  
  - No crashes during gameplay  
  - UI updates correctly after each move  

This testing plan will expand as new features are added.
