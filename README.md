# ChessTutor App

## Overview
Our project is a web application that allows users to play chess while receiving real-time tutoring and guidance. Unlike existing resources that only teach concepts *separately* from gameplay, our app actively teaches users **as they play**, helping them improve their strategic thinking, move evaluation, and overall chess skill.

If time allows, we plan to integrate an adaptive AI opponent that dynamically adjusts to the user's skill level.
